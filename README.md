# decision-table
A package for creating, validating, and executing decision tables. Allows for ensuring completeness and soundness of a decision table (as well as enumerating uncovered conditions or conflicting rules), and simplifying redundant rules. Can be used to design specs, perform decision table testing, or to execute complex conditional logic at runtime (with more completeness and correctness guarentees than afforded by TS/JS alone).

## TODO:
<!-- 1. Implement rename action method -->
<!-- 2. Implement delete var method
3. Implement delete action method -->
<!-- 4. Implement delete rule method -->
<!-- 5. Implement simplify method -->
